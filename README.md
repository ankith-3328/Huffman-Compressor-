# Huffman Coding

A Java-based implementation of Huffman Coding for efficient data compression and decompression. This project builds a Huffman Tree using character frequencies and leverages a Priority Queue to optimize tree construction.

## Features
- Compresses and decompresses text data using Huffman Encoding.
- Utilizes Priority Queue for optimal tree construction.
- Encodes input strings into binary codes and decodes them back to original text.

## How It Works
1. Calculate the frequency of each character in the input string.
2. Build a Huffman Tree using a Priority Queue, ensuring minimum cost.
3. Generate unique binary codes for each character.
4. Encode the input string using the generated codes.
5. Decode the binary string back to the original text.
